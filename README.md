**OpenEmail** by Starlight LLC is an open-integrated search-platform model-view deep learner that solves the universal question of which is superior-- Star Wars or Star Trek-- StarMail. The answer is StarMail. Specifically, the **OpenEmail** project is designed as a collaborative open-interfacing project standard to solve one of the most obvious unasked-asks of the intervening and arriving AI-entry era. For instance, we have running at home a storage unit holding our several-decade-long archive of personal and professional LLC Gmail emails (and will provide instructions on how to maneuver around Google TakeOut), and require a user (graphical) interface (such as Thunderbird) to handle the standard SMTP (mbox) filesystem and an snapshot indexed search interface (such as our existing SwiftData). But have you ever asked "Would sure be nice to search into the images in the attachments in the emails, Dave." even though that is not a question because we live one quarter through the century and still do not have that as a standard feature. Yes. So, for instance, we have a Data Processing Unit (DPU) which simply queries on regular intervals the database of emails for database objects without specified processing labels; and one of these DPUs has already been designed to take Email Units (SwiftData database objects) that contain Attachment [images] and run those through a DPU built containing set of familiar and comprehensive downstream data (such as image-to-text, object detection, person identification, GPS normalization, etc.) which then are uploaded as their own SwiftData database object type. These new SwiftData, database objects as output of DPUs, can quite understandably (naturally) be "clicked into" to be included in search when searching our primary function of searching into Email Units. These DPUs are, quite naturally, not necessarily something particularly innovative, or granually standard, or require specialists to design and implement beyond a basic undergraduate understanding of typical machine learning and algorithms and the CloudNode infrastructure schema of interfacing its components of Infrastructure (tada). A universe exists of countless varieties of the same functionality, not unlike app-ecosystems, but prone to confusion and creditability standards, which would be bad for consumers; and a universe exists of countless expansionability which allows users to quickly port data into this ecosystem of search contexts with an incredible interoperably across systems, which would be good for consumers, and expansive across to all types of data, which would engage such same consumer standards problem again and again and fractionated and again, which necessitates the open-integrated search-platform model-view deep learner approach of **OpenEmail**. See-- we even delivered on our overly ambitious question to answer which is superior-- Star Wars or Star Trek-- StarMail. The answer is StarMail.
